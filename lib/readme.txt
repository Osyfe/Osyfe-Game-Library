You need the following 3rd party libraries:

* LWJGL 3.2.3 with

- joml 1.9.24
- assimp
- glfw
- nuklear
- openal
- opengl
- remotery
- stb

* Netty 4.1.38 Final with

- netty-buffer
- netty-codec
- netty-common

The engine includes some tools in the package "osyfe.tool".

Useful/necessary 3rd party tools are:

- the ShaderValidator expects tools/glslang/bin/glslangValidator.exe
- browser based remotery viewer for profiling
- Hiero for font generation
- lwjglx: use with "-javaagent:tools/lwjglx/lwjglx-debug-1.0.0.jar"
